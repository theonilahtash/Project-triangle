###  Behavior Driven Development
IF all sides are equal: Equilateral will pop up;
If Exactly 2 sides are equal: Isosceles will pop up;
If No sides are equal: Scalene will pop up;
NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.}


### Technologies Used
{I used HTML and CSS/STYLES,JAVASCRIPT, TERMINAL AND ATOM.}

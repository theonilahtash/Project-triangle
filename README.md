{this is a Triangle Tracker},{15th September 2018}

#Authors name

##Description
{Triangle Tracker allows the user to input the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all. .}

###Behavior Driven Development
IF all sides are equal: Equilateral will pop up;
If Exactly 2 sides are equal: Isosceles will pop up;
If No sides are equal: Scalene will pop up;
NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.}


##Technologies Used
{I used HTML and CSS/STYLES,JAVASCRIPT, TERMINAL AND ATOM.}
